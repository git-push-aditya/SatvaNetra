# Satvanetra - Deepfake Detection System (Audio / Video / Image)

**Hackathon Project | CIDECode 2025 | 2nd Place Winner | ‚Çπ50,000 Prize**

Satvanetra is an advanced deepfake detection system designed to analyze audio, video, and image content using both AI/ML models and manual digital signal processing techniques. This project was created for **CIDECode 2025**, an annual hackathon organized by the Cybersecurity Department of CID Karnataka, where it secured **2nd place**.

---

## Project Overview

Satvanetra is built to detect and analyze manipulated multimedia content using a **hybrid approach**:  

1. **Automated AI/ML Detection**
   - Users upload an object (image, video, or audio) via the **Next.js frontend (`hacknext`)**.
   - Uploaded content is stored on **Supabase**, and a pre-signed URL is sent to the **Flask backend (`flaskBack`)**.
   - The backend connects to **machine learning models** to analyze the content.
   - Results are compiled into a **PDF report**, stored on Supabase, and a pre-signed URL is sent back for display.

2. **Manual Signal Analysis**
   - Deep analysis of audio, video, and images using **Fourier transforms** and other **digital signal processing** techniques.
   - Provides a secondary verdict for a deeper understanding of potential manipulations.

3. **Admin Panel**
   - Complete control and monitoring of uploads, analysis results, and system activity.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React  
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **Storage & Database:** Supabase  
- **ML / AI:** Custom deepfake detection models  
- **Data Processing:** Fourier transforms, signal analysis  
- **Deployment:** Cloud-hosted endpoints and storage

## How It Works

1. **User Upload**
   - Upload multimedia content via the frontend.
   - Frontend stores the file on Supabase and generates a pre-signed URL.

2. **Automated AI Analysis**
   - Flask backend retrieves content using pre-signed URL.
   - Runs deepfake detection ML models.
   - Generates verdict and PDF report.

3. **Manual Analysis**
   - Performs signal processing on content for additional verification.
   - Complements AI verdict for more reliable results.

4. **Results Delivery**
   - PDF report and results sent back to frontend via pre-signed URL.
   - Users and admins can view results securely.
